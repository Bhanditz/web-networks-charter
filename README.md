As a follow-up to the [Web5G Workshop](https://www.w3.org/2017/11/web5g-workshop/) organized in May 2018, a small task force of workshop participants digged in more details on what type of work might help new network advancements make a higher impact on performance both at the application and network level.

This task force presented the outcome of its research during [a dedicated TPAC breakout](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/24-webnetworks-minutes.html) ([slides](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2018Nov/att-0001/Web_NetworksAPI.pdf)), including a proposal to create a Web & Networks Interest Group to manage these long-term combined evolutions of network and application layers.

This repository aims at developing a possible charter for such a group.
